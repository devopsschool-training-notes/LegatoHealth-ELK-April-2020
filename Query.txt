When you create an index, you can define how many shards you want.  Each shard is an independent Lucene index that can be hosted anywhere in your cluster:

# Example
curl -XPUT localhost:9200/example -d '{
  "settings" : {
    "index" : {
      "number_of_shards" : 2, 
      "number_of_replicas" : 1 
    }
  }
}'

Like with shards, the number of replicas can be defined per index when the index is created.
